 Global Trends

 
Over the past decade, the global average happiness score has actually trended slightly upward — which is a bit surprising given events like the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation surges, and social unrest in various parts of the world.

What’s interesting is that even during 2020 and 2021, the scores didn't take a dramatic dip. This suggests that despite health and economic crises, factors like stronger social support systems or remote work flexibility may have helped people stay resilient.

 Regional Observations

 
Nordic countries continue to dominate the top ranks — not just in happiness, but also in dimensions like trust in government, freedom to make life choices, and social support. Finland especially checks every box across the board.

In contrast, regions like South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa consistently sit at the bottom of the rankings. However, what's fascinating is that countries in these regions often rank quite high in Generosity, suggesting a strong culture of giving, even when resources are limited.

Many Middle Eastern nations show high GDP per capita but score lower on happiness. This could point to gaps in perceived freedoms, social pressures, or perhaps dissatisfaction with public institutions.

 Country-Level Deep Dives

 
A closer look at India reveals a noticeable drop in happiness post-2019. This coincides with a tough few years — economic slowdown, the pandemic, and political polarisation may have contributed to this trend.

Meanwhile, countries like Vietnam and Uzbekistan, which aren’t usually in the headlines, are quietly climbing the happiness charts year over year. These are the kind of underdog stories that often get missed.

On the flip side, Afghanistan consistently ranks at or near the bottom in multiple dimensions — a heartbreaking but unsurprising result given the ongoing humanitarian crisis.

 Unexpected or Contrarian Patterns
 
High GDP ≠ High Happiness. This one keeps coming up. Some countries with enormous wealth don’t necessarily rank high on happiness — suggesting that money without trust or freedom doesn’t guarantee well-being.

Generosity isn't linked to income. Countries like Myanmar, Kenya, and Indonesia rank very high in generosity, despite being far from economically prosperous. There’s clearly something cultural going on there.

One of the strongest predictors of happiness across countries is Social Support — not GDP, not freedom, and not even health. This alone is worth deeper exploration in policymaking.

 Summary

 
This dataset goes far beyond just numbers — it tells stories. Stories about resilience, inequality, trust, and community. While GDP and economic indicators still matter, this dashboard makes one thing very clear:

"People don’t just want to be rich — they want to feel supported, safe, and free."
